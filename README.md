# FRC Team 3171 Hurricanes - Command-Based Robot Code

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **FRC Team 3171 Hurricanes**!  
This project contains the **Java Command-Based Robot Code** developed by our team, designed to teach and implement modern FRC best practices.

## Overview

This repository showcases a robust and modular **Command-Based robot architecture** tailored for the 2025 season. 
The robot features a **swerve drive system**, powered by [YAGSL (Yet Another Generic Swerve Library)](https://docs.yagsl.com/), and utilizes **PathPlanner** to execute complex autonomous routines.

This codebase not only powers our competition robot but also serves as an **educational tool** to help students learn:

- Object-oriented design and subsystem-based robot code
- Working with elevator mechanisms and drivetrain systems
- Tuning PIDs for precise motion control
- Autonomous path planning with PathPlanner
- Real-time command scheduling and safe resource management

## Features

### Command-Based Structure
- Modular subsystem and command organization
- Built using WPILibâ€™s Command-Based architecture
- Easy to scale and extend with new robot features

### Swerve Drive with YAGSL
- Clean integration of YAGSL for field-oriented swerve control
- Highly configurable drivetrain tuning via constants
- Encoder and gyroscope integration for accurate odometry

### Autonomous with PathPlanner
- Autonomous paths created and visualized with [PathPlanner](https://pathplanner.dev/home.html)
- Command-based integration for event markers and smooth path following

### PID Tuning Education
- Teaches students how to tune PID loops for:
  - Swerve drive modules
  - Elevator mechanism for vertical motion
- Runtime PID constants logging and live-tuning via Shuffleboard

## Educational Goals
Teach students to:
- Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Understand the fundamentals of control systems
- Collaborate using Git
- Practice clean and responsible coding techniques
